// Possibilities:
// * It's a draft in the trash, never modified. Offer to make it available
// in this locale for the first time. If they say yes, force export it from
// the current locale.
// * It's a draft in the trash, modified. Offer to rescue it from the trash.
// * It's not a draft. Offer to go to the draft. If they say yes,
// apply the rules above to rescue it in the most useful way, switch to
// draft and go to it.
